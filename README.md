## AWS Snowflake Data Pipeline using Kinesis & Airflow 

The AWS Snowflake data pipeline leverages Amazon Kinesis for real-time data streaming and Apache Airflow for orchestration. Kinesis ensures seamless ingestion of data into Snowflake, a cloud-based data warehouse. In this setup, Kinesis acts as a scalable and durable buffer for streaming data, allowing for efficient processing. Airflow, an open-source platform, manages and schedules data workflows, orchestrating the entire pipeline. This integration enables organizations to handle large volumes of data in real-time, ensuring data accuracy and timeliness. The AWS Snowflake data pipeline, powered by Kinesis and Airflow, offers a robust solution for scalable, reliable, and automated data processing in the cloud
